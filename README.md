# Laravel Learning

* This repository has the only purpose to control version of Laracast's tutorial project for Laravel 5.4, though I'm using 5.5 and checking what is different. I'll do this README.md a sort of diary for my progress and what I learned.

* Until 17/09/2017, I've watched until lesson 13. I'll update this list better later so I won't need to write it down all at once.
